**This is part one of a post series. Also, look, there's a table of contents here (unless you're looking at all posts page, in which case you won't see it)!**

I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. Noâ€¦ It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Saving the world with meals on wheels.
