That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. I've opened a door here that I regret. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?

I hear the jury's still out on science. That's why you always leave a note! Marry me. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! I've opened a door here that I regret.
