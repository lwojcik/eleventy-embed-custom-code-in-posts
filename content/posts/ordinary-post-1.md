**Nothing to see here. It's just a placeholder. No really, go away.**

Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Oh sure! Blame the wizards! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!

I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! But existing is basically all I do! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.

Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.

Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Is the Space Pope reptilian!? For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. I can explain. It's very valuable. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV.
